# Madhav_Store_Ecommerce_Dashboard

### Overview:
My inaugural Power BI project involves creating a comprehensive report for Madhav Store, an ecommerce business in India, to track and analyze sales data. This interactive report aims to empower the owner with deeper insights into their online sales across the country.

**Project Objectives:**

Design an interactive report for real-time tracking and analysis of ecommerce sales data.
Implement sophisticated parameters for detailed drill-down capabilities, customized with filters and slicers.
Manipulate data by creating connections, joining new tables, and performing calculations.
Utilize various customized visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, cards, and slicers.
Implement data-driven parameters for enhanced visualization and deeper insights, facilitating informed decision-making for business growth.

**Tasks Performed:**

Transformed data using Power Query for optimal analysis.
Utilized DAX Queries for calculating APQ (Amount per quantity).
Employed a variety of visualizations to present data effectively.
Added slicer functionality to enable easy checking of Quarterly and State-wise data.

**Useful Insights:**

1) Payment Mode Impact: Maximum sales are driven through Cash on Delivery (COD) payment mode, suggesting the importance of offering COD as an option for all products.
2) Product Category Trends: Clothing dominates product categories with the highest sum of quantity, while furniture records the lowest sales.
3) Geographical Impact: Maharashtra leads in the highest sum of amount, contributing 40.79% to the total. Other top states include Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi.
4) Quarterly Performance: Exceptional performance observed in Quarter 1.
5) Top Buyer Recognition: Harivansh emerges as the top buyer, accounting for 29.67% of sales. Recognizing and rewarding top customers like Madhav, Madan Mohan, and Shiva with gift vouchers can foster loyalty.

**Key Learnings:**

1. Developing a dynamic report with real-time tracking capabilities.
2. Using advanced parameters, filters, and slicers for detailed analysis.
3. Transforming data with Power Query and implementing DAX Queries.
4. Creating diverse visualizations for effective data representation.

**Conclusion:**

This Power BI project not only serves as a valuable tool for Madhav Store but also demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing Power BI for in-depth data analysis and visualization in the ecommerce domain.
