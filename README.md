🔰 Useful insights :-
🏹 Maximum sales are driven through COD payment mode , hence we should try to have COD option available for all projects.
🏹 Clothing dominated the product categories with highest Sum of Quantity, whereas furniture has lowest sales .
🏹 #Maharashtra led with the highest Sum of Amount, contributing 40.79% to total. other top states were #Madhyapradesh, #Uttarpradesh and #Delhi.
🏹 We have performed very well in quarter 1.
🏹 Harivansh emerged as top buyer, accounting for 29.67% of sales. Madhav , Madan Mohan and Shiva closely followed. these top customers who have made maximum purchase can be rewarded with some gift vouchers for being loyal customers.
